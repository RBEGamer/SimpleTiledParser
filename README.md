# SimpleTiledParser
A simple parser to parse maps from the TiledMapEditor (http://mapeditor.org/) into your Game.

* Tile animations
* Tile properties
* Layer properties

Currently not supported :
* Only CSV Encoding with no compression !
* No Terrain support
* No <tileset offset> tag support


Best practise is to place animated tiles in a different layer!
